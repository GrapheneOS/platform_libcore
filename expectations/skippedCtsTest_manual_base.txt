/*
 * Manual entries for skippedCtsTest.txt.
 * tools/non-cts-json-generator/update_skippedCtsTest.sh reads this file and merges the entries
 * with the @NonCts tests into skippedCtsTest.txt.
 * It's useful for tests deleted from aosp/main, but the test needs to be skipped on the older
 * CTS branches, e.g. aosp/android12-tests-dev. skippedCtsTest.txt can later be sync-ed to those
 * CTS branches.
